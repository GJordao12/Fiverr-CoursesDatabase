# Courses Database (Fiverr Project)

* **Language:** SQL and PLSQL
* **Project Description:** The objective of the project was to develop a database for a company where the courses available for them and everything related to them (students, schedules, ...) could be stored. In addition, it was necessary to create [queries](/SQLFiles/queries.sql), [procedures](/SQLFiles/procedures.sql) and [functions](/SQLFiles/functions.sql) so that later, through the requested user interface, it was possible to observe certain data. It was also requested that the database be loaded with test information, so [inserts](/SQLFiles/inserts.sql) had to be created.
