# Courses Database (Fiverr Project)

* **Language:** SQL and PLSQL
* **Project Description:** The objective of the project was to develop a database for a company where the courses available for them and everything related to them (students, schedules, ...) could be stored. In addition, it was necessary to create queries, procedures and functions so that later, through the requested user interface, it was possible to observe certain data. It was also requested that the database be loaded with test information, so inserts had to be created.
